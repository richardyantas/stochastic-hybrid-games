\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}
In the \emph{Hybrid Solar Water Heating} case study we evaluated the 
existing \textsc{uppaal stratego} controller synthesis subject to certain
operation modes called patterns wich ensure a safe system behaviour, this
methodology helps enginners not only guarantee a safe controller 
but also some strategies which optimize trough reinforcement learning
given by \textsc{uppaal stratego}. The proposal was successfully 
concatenated finding safe and near optimal control strategies for our 
controller.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\label{sec:limitations}

To reduce the complexity to compute patterns on way to face problems
related dynamic setpoint configurations would be to have more than 
one R regions.

\myparagraph{Solar car}
The latest advances in solar machines are cars, this system interact with
disturbances which is irradiances, the roads to stop the car lose energy.
This would work with spatial trajectories as spatio temporal series of data.
