\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We showed that the \emph{Hybrid Solar Water Heating} case study can 
be modeled as a \ac{SHG} and apply formal 
controller synthesis to automatically derive controllers 
for our \ac{SWH}, such that symbolic and reinforced learning 
techniques from \textsc{uppaal stratego} are used. This evaluation 
is subject to certain operation modes called patterns wich ensure 
a safe coontrol.

The use of zonotopes allows an efficient implementation of the 
stochastic controller synthesis with \textsc{stratego}. The experimental
 evaluation showed that this method can compute a safe control strategy 
 in a short horizon $75$ minutes and also the cost function was 
 significantly optimized comparable in performance to the \emph{greedy} 
 controller. The  framework developed is adapted to an online 
 model-predictive control setting and helps engineers not only guarantee 
 a  safe controller  but also apply formal controller synthesis to 
 automatically derive controllers through reinforcement learning given
by \textsc{uppaal stratego}.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}

Future research directions; Although it is true that we use
real environment data, temperature of input water is not provided. However,
considering not variations we set a constant temperature, which in fact 
change in time, would be interesting to test the simulator with real 
input water temperatures. Additionally, the distributions of perturbations
was modelled using 1 uniform distribution and 2 normal distribution, 
around $7h$ and $19h$. However, a more realistic distributions can be 
obtained through historical data provided by the interaction
between members of family in a house and our algorithm.


% To reduce the complexity to compute patterns on way to face problems
% related dynamic setpoint configurations would be to have more than 
% one R regions.
% \myparagraph{Solar car}
% The latest advances in solar machines are cars, this system interact
%  with disturbances which is irradiances, the roads to stop the car 
%  lose energy. This would work with spatial trajectories as spatio
%   temporal series of data.
