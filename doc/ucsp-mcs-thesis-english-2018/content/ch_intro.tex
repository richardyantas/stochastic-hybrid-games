    \section{Motivation and Context}
    \label{sec:motivation}
    %%%TODO: FALTA MAS TEXTO EN LA MOTIVATION

    Hybrid systems are widely used in engineering applications and its 
    importance has grown up considerably these last years, because of their 
    ease of implementation for controlling cyber-physical systems.
    A switched systems is a set of dynamical systems, each with its own 
    dynamical behaviour controlled by a parameter mode $u$ whose values 
    are in a finite set $U$(See ~\cite{liberzon2003switching}). However, due to the composition of many switched systems together, the global switched systems has a number of modes and dynamics which increases exponentially. 
    Switched systems have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, the automotive industry, and many other fields. 

    \section{Problem Statement}
    \label{sec:problem}
    Nowadays, there is a large number of methods to solve switched systems;
    however, it does not have guarantee in safety. For that reason, we 
    propose a new approach to solve switched systems. 
    
    \section{Objectives}
    \label{sec:objectives}

        \subsection*{General Objective}
        Our main objective is to propose a pipeline to solve switched systems guarantee safety and near optimal synthesis controllers. 

        \subsection*{Specific Objectives}
        To achieve our main objective, we have the following specific objectives:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Define a case of study as a stochastic hybrid game and get its mathematical model.
            \item Implement and explore safe patterns for the model.
            \item Implement an \textsc{api} between the simulator and \textsc{uppaal} to Optimize the model.
            \item Compare results with traditional methods with our methodology.
        \end{itemize}


    \section{Contributions}
    \label{sec:contributions}
        This thesis proposes a novel approach to solve 
        switched systems guaranteeing safety and optimal
        controller synthesis.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item We propose a method to guarantee safe controller. This methods consider three regions to have reachability and safety in the system.
                    \item We also demonstrate the utility of the proposed method comparing with traditional methods.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Find a near optimal patterns to online control(\cite{larsen2016online}).
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Implement an \textsc{api} between simulator and \textsc{uppaal}.

    \section{Outline}
    %\label{sec:outline}
    This thesis document is divided into five chapters. After this 
    introduction and problem formulation, in \autoref{ch:relatedWorks}
     we survey the literature about the recent research in safety
      controllers and near optimal online controller synthesis. 
    \autoref{ch:background} presents some basic concepts about the
    hybrid systems, traditional controllers,
    stability criteria and optimal controller technique. Next, in
    Chapter x we describe in detail the corpus, techniques used 
    by our pipeline and their evaluation results. Finally, the 
    limitations, future works, and conclusions of this work are 
    presented in Chapter.
