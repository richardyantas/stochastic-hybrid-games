Stochastic hybrid systems are widely used in the energy industry, 
problems such as optimization and safety are some of the most 
important. We implement a methodology to improve a real time stochastic 
hybrid system combining model checking, reinforcement learning and boundary
computation.  We apply formal methods to synthetize (i.e derive automatically)
a safe and near optimal controller. To verify the methodology, we model a 
solar water heating, including 
the human interaction to access the water in it as stochastic. Additionally, 
we use the tool \textsc{Uppaal Stratego} to synthetize a control strategy 
minimizing a cost function composed by energy consumption(\emph{optimization})
and temperature distance (\emph{safety}) while the last one also guaranteeing
no overflow a max and min temperature defined previously.
