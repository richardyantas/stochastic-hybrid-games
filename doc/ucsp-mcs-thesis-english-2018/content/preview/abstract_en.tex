Nowadays, hybrid systems are widely used in industry problems like
optimization and safety are some of the most important, due to some 
advances in machine learning and model Checking was possible to 
implement a methodology to improve a real time system using reinforcement
learning and boundary computation to explore limits in order to guarantee 
a safe and near optimal behaviour. Hybrid systems that are most common in 
engineering applications(\eg logic-dynamic controllers, internet 
congestion even physical systems with impact,\etc). Hybrid systems 
have been used to model several cyber-physical systems. For this purpose,
in this document we implement a"Solar water heating" as case study in order 
to analize metrics which allow us to evaluate our results comparing
with traditional controllers. In additionm we present a toolbox 
\textsc{Uppaal Stratego} to explore multiple strategy  in efficient 
way and get patterns which allow us to optimize.
