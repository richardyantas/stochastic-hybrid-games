control synthesis:

Very abstractly, controller synthesis, given a model of the assumed behaviour of the environment and a system goal, 
produces an operational behaviour model for a component that when executing in an environment consistent with the assumptions 
results in a system that is guaranteed to satisfy the goal.

We have an automata as a hybrid system thus a control synthesis is to find
one strategy to optimize the behavour in other words, to satisfy the goal 


undecidable?

The verification of continuous and hybrid systems is a challenging problem,
 and various approaches are currently being investigated to overcome the complexities of 
 representing and computing with continuous sets of states. Since verification problems 
 are generally undecidable for such systems, experimental results are vital for
  evaluating and developing new ideas.
